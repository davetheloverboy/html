         So i am Dave Jared S. Gabuat and i just want to say that it is my birthday tomorrow 
         i would like to have a birthday present, anything will do you know 
         but i would like it to be coming from the heart. SO 
         anything will do as long as you gave it with no regrets or hard feeling you know
         So i will talk about myself. I am a 15 yer old student from the Philippines
         i am a grade 10 student already which means tomorrow i will become a 16 year old guy
         so this is my last day of being a 15 year old, sadly i will say goodbye to my memories
         of this years soon since i will be moving on the next level.
         So this year was a blast! sadly the pandemic strike the world
         resulting to cancellation of the things that people have been planning to do
         so i had a lot of good experiences but sadly it didn't lasted. So i thank all the people 
         tha was part of my 15 year old career and i am expecting to be with y'all in the next years to come
         and i wish to God that this pandemic will be over.
